        <h1 class="fw-semibold text-danger">Question 1 :Differents between var,let and const?</h1>
        <h3> Answer : var keyword in JavaScript: The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in
            JavaScript.Scope:Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or
            function scope. It meansvariables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables
            defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function.<br><br>
            let keyword in JavaScript: The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.<br>
            Scope: block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can’t be accessible outside the
            particular block ({block}). Let’s see the below example.<br><br>
            const keyword in JavaScript: The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword,
            except the user cannot update it.

            Scope: block scoped: When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns
            an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.

        <h1 class="fw-semibold text-danger"> Question 2 : Differents between regular function and arrow function?</h1>
        <h3>Ans : regular functio=>Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is
            dynamic.

            The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript,
            there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.<br><br>
            arrow function =>The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular
            function's this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.

            No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this value from
            the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves this lexically.

        <h1 class="fw-semibold text-danger">Question 3 : How to use template string?</h1>
        <h3>Ans : Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line
            strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged
            templates.

            Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for
            string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template
            literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations
            you want on the different parts of the template literal.</h3>
